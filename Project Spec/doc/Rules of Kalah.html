<h1>Kalah - Rules of the Game</h1>


Kalah is a two player, turn-based game. In the standard version of the
game, it is played with a board consisting of 12 small pits, two
scoring wells and 72 stones. Each player (North and South)
<i>owns</i> the six holes closest to them (numbered 1 - 6) and one
scoring well. The game starts with 6 stones in each pit. The figure
below shows the board. <p></p>

<p>However, that version of the game is solved, so in this project, you will be playing an expanded version of the game. There are 7 pits per side, and each pit starts with 7 stones.</p>

<p> A standard nomenclature for versions of the game is (p,s), where p is the number of pits per side, and s is the number of stones in each pit at the start. The standard game is (6,6) although (6,3) is often used for beginners. Your bot will be playing the (7,7) version of the game. </p>

top:0px;width:644px;height:361px"><img width="644" height="361" src="./Rules of Kalah_files/image001.gif"></span><br clear="ALL">
</p><p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The game starts with six seeds in each non-scoring hole. The
game ends when one player does not have a legal move. The winner is the player
with the most seeds in their scoring well. </p>

<h2>Start of Play</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">The game starts with 7 seeds in each of the small holes.
South goes first. </p>

<h2>How Play Proceeds</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">The player whose turn it is chooses one of the 7 holes they
own which is not empty. The seeds from that hole are removed and deposited one
by one into the subsequent holes moving counter clockwise, skipping only the
opponent's scoring well. (Example moves are shown below). </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If the last seed is deposited into the current player's
scoring well, that player must take another turn. (An exception to this is the
first turn, see Pie Rule). </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If the last seed is deposited into an empty hole owned by
the current player and the hole opposite is not empty, the player captures all
of the seeds in the opposite hole plus the capturing seed, which go into the
player's scoring well. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The player's turn ends with a capture or when the last seed
is deposited into a hole other than the player's scoring well. </p>

<h2>End of the Game</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">If it is a player's turn and all of his holes are empty,
then he has no legal move and the game ends. All seeds which are not in one of
the scoring wells are deposited into the well of the opposing player. The
player whose scoring well contains the most seeds is the winner. </p>

<h2>The Pie Rule</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">Although this game has not been solved yet, it appears that
there is a big first player advantage. The pie rule is implemented in many
games for which this is the case, to make it more fair. The basic idea is that the
2<sup>nd</sup> player has at its first turn only an extra move: swap positions
with the other player (e.g. turn the board around). We implement this as
follows:</p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpFirst" style="text-indent:-18.0pt">1.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
the start of the game, South goes first. South has only one
  turn, <b><span style="color:red">even if it
ends in the last seed deposited into South's scoring well</span>. </b></p>

<p class="MsoListParagraphCxSpLast" style="text-indent:-18.0pt">2.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
North's first turn, it has an extra move: SWAP. If he plays swap, he becomes
South, South becomes North and it is North's turn. At the this point, whether
or not SWAP has been played, play proceeds according to the normal rules. </p>

<p> Here is an example of the Pie Rule. Before the game starts, Sally
  is South, Noddy is North. Sally opens with a brilliant move, almost
  ensuring that she will win. Noddy swaps. Now Sally is North and must immediately
  respond with a move against her own brilliant opening move. Noddy is
  now South, and plays with the benefit of Sally's opening move. </p>

<h2>Example Play</h2>

<p class="MsoNormal">The rules will be illustrated from the starting position
below. It is North's turn. North chooses well 6.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="position:relative;z-index:2;left:-7px;
top:0px;width:645px;height:361px"><img width="645" height="361" src="./Rules of Kalah_files/image002.gif"></span><br clear="ALL">
This moves one seed to North's scoring well and one to Souths hole number 1. After
this move, the board looks like this: (seeds are colored to make the moves more
clear). This ends North's turn. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="position:relative;z-index:4;left:-16px;
top:0px;width:645px;height:361px"><img width="645" height="361" src="./Rules of Kalah_files/image003.gif"></span><br clear="ALL">
Now it is South's turn. South chooses hole 5. This results a seed deposited
into hole 6 and one into South's scoring well. As that is the last seed
deposited, South gets another turn. South then chooses hole 2. This results in
the last seed being deposited into the empty hole 4, thereby capturing the
seeds in North's hole 3. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">At the start of South's turn, the board looks like this:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="position:relative;z-index:3;left:-2px;
top:0px;width:644px;height:361px"><img width="644" height="361" src="./Rules of Kalah_files/image004.gif"></span><br clear="ALL">
At the end of the turn, it looks like this:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="position:relative;z-index:5;left:-2px;
top:0px;width:644px;height:361px"><img width="644" height="361" src="./Rules of Kalah_files/image005.gif"></span><br clear="ALL">
